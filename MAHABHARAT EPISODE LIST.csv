He was in his mother's womb when Krishna was explaining the battle formation to Subhadra. But she feel asleep mid-way and Abhimanyu could only hear half the explanation.
Abhimanyu asked Krishna several times to tell him the way to exit, but Krishna told him ask Arjun. Abhimanyu never met Arjun properly. So, his knowledge remained incomplete.That night Susarma agrees with Duryodhan to not engage Arjun in a fight, but only to lure him far away from the battle.
