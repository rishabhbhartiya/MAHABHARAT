Shakuni doubts Drona's loyalty towards the Kauravas. Shakuni is worried if Drona will be able to fulfill his promise to capture Yudhishthir, due to his love for the Pandavas. Drona has been missing from camp and Shakuni believes that he would have gone to meet Pandavas to brief them on his war strategy for the following day.<br/><br/>Drona arrives back and says that it is not possible to capture Yudhishthir while Arjun is near him. They decide to find a warrior who can challenge Arjun in battle and lure him far away from Yudhishthir.
The Trigartha Chief Susarma is asked to assist the Kauravas in their plan to capture Yudhishthir by luring Arjun so far away from the battlefield that it will be impossible for him to return before sunset. Susarma agrees to the plan.
Susarma engages Arjun in battle and keeps retreating slowly to draw him away from the battlefield. Bheem warns Arjun against pursuing Susarma as he knows this is Drona's war strategy, but Arjun can't resist the challenge. Arjun leaves Yudhishthir under Bheem's protection. Bheem knows that he can stop the entire Kauravas army, but he cannot stop Drona.<br/><br/>Predictably Drona attacks. He engages Bheem, Nakul, and Sahadev in battle, who were protecting Yudhishthir. Drona incapacitated Bheem with his arrows. Nakul and Sahadev are disarmed. Once again, Drona disarms Yudhishthir by breaking all his weapons (his bows, javelins, and swords). Drona moves in to capture Yudhishthir, as the Pandavas have no weapons left to defend themselves. Arjun again returns in time to save Yudhishthir. Soon, it is sunset, and the war ends for the day.<br/><br/>That night Duryodhan questions Drona's loyalty openly. He says he sacrificed thousands of soldiers to support Drona's strategy to capture Yudhishthir, yet Drona did not deliver. Duryodhan says that Drona kept on waiting for Arjun to arrive and save Yudhishthir.
Drona says that he would have captured Yudhishthir if Arjun was even further away from the battle.
Drona decides to arrange his forces in a ""Chakra-Vyuha"" (Lotus formation), which is a battle arrangement that only Arjun can penetrate and emerge from. If Arjun is away from the battlefield, the Pandavas will certainly lose the war the following day.
Drona catches a spy that was going to reveal his strategy to Yudhishthir. Drona knows that in the Pandavas army only Krishna and Arjun know how to unravel the Chakra-Vyuha.<br/><br/>Drona doesn't know that Abhimanyu knows how to enter the Chakra-Vyuha, but not how to exit it. He was in his mother's womb when Krishna was explaining the battle formation to Subhadra. But she feel asleep mid-way and Abhimanyu could only hear half the explanation.
Abhimanyu asked Krishna several times to tell him the way to exit, but Krishna told him ask Arjun. Abhimanyu never met Arjun properly. So, his knowledge remained incomplete.<br/><br/>That night Susarma agrees with Duryodhan to not engage Arjun in a fight, but only to lure him far away from the battle.
He agrees to this cheating only if Duryodhan agrees to free Yudhishthir after capturing him and ending the war.</div>",6.4
